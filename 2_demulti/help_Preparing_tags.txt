If you are a beginner in this area, please take a look in the PDF file "demultiplex_Illumina_merged_pairs.pdf" available above
This script format your tags according Cutadapt method
to run just type: 
perl preparing_tags_LCPI.pl
and it will ask your mapping_file to edit and which format you need.

you can edit the formatting, for example, removing the 3' anchor from 'linked' mode:
the signs $ and ^ are the anchor signs, you can carefully edit the script removing or adding it. Example, leave only 5' end anchored:
push (@new_file1, (">$sample\n^$tag_F...$tag_R\$\n"));
push (@new_file2, (">$sample\n^$RCtagR...$RCtagF\$\n"));
push (@new_file3, (">$sample\n^$tag_F...$RCtagR\$\n"));
					just remove the '^' sign in the 3' end (first tag from mapping file):
					">$sample\n$tag_F...$tag_R\$\n"
					">$sample\n$RCtagR...$RCtagF\$\n"
					">$sample\n$tag_F...$RCtagR\$\n"
Likewise, leave only 3' end anchored:
					just remove the '$' sign in the 5' end (second tag from mapping file):
					">$sample\n^$tag_F...$tag_R\n"
					">$sample\n^$RCtagR...$RCtagF\n"
					">$sample\n^$tag_F...$RCtagR\n"

I strongly recommend to keep BOTH anchored for Ion Torrent dual index strategy!!!
Similarly, I recommend to run BOTH anchored for Illumina merged paired ends design as well, but since in this
