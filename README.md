Welcome!

Yellow flag!! I am still working on the README's text and some connection between scripts, please don't mind about typing errors, as soon as possible all READMEs will be reviewed. 

A little of history...
After some time studying and working with metabarcoding pipeline(s) I realized that I could help young researchers who are starting now, as I was some time ago, providing a humble guide throughout the metabarcoding data processing workflow. The name 'METAPIPE' pop up spontaneously due to work dynamics, I felt easier to talk about the pipeline using a nickname. After a long time of trials and lots of error messages, METAPIPE is running without errors from start to end, both in bash and job queue (slurm), according to the sample data available here. More details in README.workflow and README.general.

Baby steps...
For those who have just started working with metabarcoding, there is a README for each step, along with a README for each script and the tools help (--help) pages, for those who still don't have access to a server or linux machine.

Next steps...
1 --> I'm working on including Mothur and QIIME pipelines along with each METAPIPE steps, as much user friendly as possible.
2 --> For now the only METAPIPE branch running from sequencing to statistics is the local alignment BLAST do PHYLOSEQ. It works with NCBI and BOLD references. MOre detailes in README.workflow.

Thank you for visiting my Github, I hope I can help :)
