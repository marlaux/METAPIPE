The derep_vsearch.sh script runs the dereplication by sample and the global dereplication independently from the chain.

This step gives you the dereplicated fastas by sample and the global dereplicated multifasta, which is the INPUT for the clustering step. 
line 9: Change the name of the global dereplicated multifasta.

If you choose to run the 3_read_cleaning tag_primer_clipping_part1 and 2 wrapped scripts, you have to skip the independent 4_dereplicate step, because in the end of the tag_primer_clipping_part2.sh script you get the dereplicated by sample fastas '*derep.fasta' and the global dereplication is in the beginning of the clustering_swarm_complete.sh script, in the 5_clustering step.

Dereplication identifies potential PCR duplicates, and their abundance is added in the header of head sequence, so this original abundance information is keeped up to the end of the analysis.
